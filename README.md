# schoolGrades

A function that stores students and their grades throughout the year. 
The input is an array of string elemnts, each holding students name and their grades. If a student appears more than once, the program adds the new grades to existing ones. Finally, it prints the students and their average grades, sorted alphabetically by student name. The average grades are fixed to the second decimal place.
